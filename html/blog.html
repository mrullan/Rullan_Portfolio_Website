            I found this to be a very entertaining video. It is from the youtube channel, Stuff Made Here, by a guy named Shane. The channel features
            many projects such as this where Shane takes various projects and showcases his process of designing and building the project. Shane himself
            is brilliant, all of his projects are built from the ground up, with tools that he has available in his workshop. One thing I enjoy about these videos
            is seeing the process for projects like this one that require computing, and watching him go through the basics of how he programmed 
            the build to function in the way he wants, and the problems that occur, as well as how he eventually solved them, or how he had to reevaluate his approach.
